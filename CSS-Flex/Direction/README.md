This folder contains the learning files that I used in learning the basics of flex-direction.

Flex direction property works only when the display property is set to flex, and then the flex-direction which is by default set to row can also be set to column where they appear as both rows and columns respectively.
flex-basis aids in determining the size of the rows or columns, in rows in determines the width, but in column in determines the height.
